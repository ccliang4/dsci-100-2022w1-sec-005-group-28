    "It is difficult to predict with confidence what we will find by analyzing music types and MBTI because music preference is complex and highly unique. However, we may be able to find correlations between certain MBTI types and specific factors in music, such as energy levels, danceability, key, loudness, etc. Using these trends we hope to predict an individual’s MBTI type based on variables of the music they enjoy.\n",

    "Although the MBTI system is a controversial topic in the psychology community due to its inability to fully represent the intricacies of human personality, our project may prove to be useful in developing a general understanding of the relationship between music and personality. This knowledge may be purposeful in many areas, including but not limited to:\n",
